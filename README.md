# Word_Embedding_GloVe.py
We implement a version of "GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation' by Pennington et. al. changing the gradient descent method from AdaGrad to RMSPROP. The program is written in python and for educational purposes and further optimization are required to increase speed and performance. The script was tested on CoNLL-03 training data.
